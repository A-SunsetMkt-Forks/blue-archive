# Rules on Writing Vue Components

- Always use composition APIs unless user explicitedly asks you to use options APIs.
- Avoid embedding complex logic directly in templates; instead, use computed properties or methods.
- Use watchers to handle side effects due to data changes, while avoiding excessive reliance on them.
- Use lifecycle methods appropriately to handle asynchronous data, subscriptions, or side effects.
